# ðŸŒŠ Flood Risk Prediction for India

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to develop a **machine learning model** that predicts **continuous flood risk scores** for regions in India, using historical meteorological and hydrological data from **IMD** and **NASA** datasets. The model's output will be visualized on an **interactive web-based map**, enabling better preparedness and disaster management.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Gather and preprocess **multi-source flood-related datasets**.
- Train a model capable of producing **fine-resolution flood risk maps**.
- Integrate the prediction results into a **Leaflet.js-based interactive UI**.
- Provide **risk heatmaps** for major Indian cities and regions.
- Display relevant environmental and hydrological data for each region.
